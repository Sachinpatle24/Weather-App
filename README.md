Weather Forecast Website

This is a simple weather forecast website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for weather details of any city and also check the weather for their current location. The site displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, and the background changes based on the weather condition.

The data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API, and the design is clean, responsive, and easy to use.
